## Bot Instructions

Tic-Tac-Toe is a very popular game, which consists in making a sequence of three symbols in either a row, column or diagonal in a 3x3 board.

To play the game follow the getting started steps mentioned before. After you done that, run the "main" file and follow these steps:

- First you need to introduce player one name.
- Then you need to introduce player two name.
- The game will display the board.
- Player one choose a position in the board from 1 to 9 which is not occupied.
- Player two choose a position in the board from 1 to 9 which is not occupied.

- You will have turns, in sequence until there is a winner or the board is full which would result in a tie.
- If you want to play again you can type bin/main again and the game will reset.
- Have fun!.
